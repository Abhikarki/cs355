            <p id = "desc">JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used to add interactivity and other
                 dynamic elements to websites. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs directly in the user's web 
                 browser, rather than on a server. This allows for a rich and dynamic user experience without the need to constantly 
                 refresh the page.
                One of the most common uses of JavaScript is to change the appearance of a webpage in
                 response to user actions. For example, changing the <span id = "tx">size of the image</span>, changing the font, etc.</p>
